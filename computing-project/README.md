Computing project for goldsmiths

Hello whoever may be reading this, this is a dense react + express project

there are some dependencies that may be broken and clashing but here is how to fix it:

cd backend
npm install --force
cd ../frontend/barber-app
npm install --force

then make a new terminal, one specifically for running the backend
cd backend
node . or nodemon .

for front end
cd frontend/barber-app
npm start
